        "body": "Wildfire is a part of nature. It plays a key role in shaping ecosystems by serving as an agent of renewal and change. But fire can be deadly, destroying homes, wildlife habitat and timber, and polluting the air with emissions harmful to human health. Fire also releases carbon dioxide—a key greenhouse gas—into the atmosphere. Fire effects are influenced by forest conditions before the fire and management action taken or not taken after the fire, and may be long-lasting.\n\nScientists with the Pacific Northwest Research Station are conducting a range of studies pertaining to fire effects on the environment in multiple fields of study, from meteorology to ecology. Learn more by clicking on a topic below to jump to that section.\nFire behavior broadly refers to a fire’s intensity and rate of spread. More specifically, it is the way fuel ignites and how flames develop. Scientists who study fire behavior are interested in factors that influence fire intensity and rate of spread, such as fuel types, weather, and topography. “Extreme” fire behavior indicates fire that does not respond to the usual methods of direct suppression, usually because of rapid spread, fire in the tree canopy (e.g., crowning), and formation of fire-related weather systems (e.g., pyrocumulus clouds). Station scientists have developed comprehensive syntheses of knowledge about extreme fire behavior for managers.\nClimate change is contributing to the increased risk and extent of wildfires in the Western United States. Wildfire risk depends on complex interactions between temperature, soil moisture, and the presence of trees, shrubs, and other potential fuels. All these factors have strong direct or indirect links with climate variability and climate change. Station scientists have found that climate change increases the potential for very large fires in the United States.\nFire ecology explores the interactions between fire and the surrounding environment, including both living and nonliving things. Fire ecologists recognize that fire is a natural process that is often integral to the life history of plants and animals in the ecosystem. Station scientists study fire effects on ecosystems, fire history, how plants and animals depend on or adapt to fire, and fire regimes. A “fire regime” refers to the general pattern of wildfire’s natural occurrence in a particular ecosystem, including fire frequency, intensity, size, pattern, season, and severity."

        "title": "Racism in the united states",

        "content": "Why is racism still exists?",
        "body": "Racism in the United States comprises negative attitudes and views on race or ethnicity which are related to each other, are held by various people and groups in the United States and have been reflected in discriminatory laws, practices and actions at various times in the history of the United States (including violence) against racial or ethnic groups. Throughout United States history, white Americans have generally enjoyed legally or socially sanctioned privileges and rights which have been denied to members of various ethnic or minority groups at various times. European Americans, particularly affluent white Anglo-Saxon Protestants, are said to have enjoyed advantages in matters of education, immigration, voting rights, citizenship, land acquisition, and criminal procedure.\n\nRacism against various ethnic or minority groups has existed in the United States since the colonial era. African Americans in particular have faced restrictions on their political, social, and economic freedoms throughout much of United States history. Native Americans have suffered genocide, forced removals, and massacres, and they continue to face discrimination. Non-Protestant immigrants from Europe, particularly Jews, Irish people, Poles, and Italians, were often subjected to xenophobic exclusion and other forms of ethnicity-based discrimination. In addition, Hispanics, Middle Eastern Americans, and Asian Americans along with Pacific Islanders have also been discriminated against.\n\nRacism has manifested itself in a variety of ways, including genocide, slavery, segregation, Native American reservations, Native American boarding schools, immigration and naturalization laws, and internment camps.[a] Formal racial discrimination was largely banned by the mid-20th century and over time, coming to be perceived as being socially and morally unacceptable. Racial politics remains a major phenomenon, and racism continues to be reflected in socioeconomic inequality.[1][b] In recent years research has uncovered extensive evidence of racial discrimination in various sectors of modern U.S. society, including the criminal justice system, business, the economy, housing, health care, the media, and politics. In the view of the United Nations and the U.S. Human Rights Network, \"discrimination in the United States permeates all aspects of life and extends to all communities of color.\""

        "content": "Why is global warming still increase rapidly throughout years",
        "body": "Global climate change is the existential threat of our time. Caused by human activities, the impacts of climate change—rising sea levels, extreme weather and natural disasters, new cycles of flooding and drought, and economic instability, among others—disproportionately affect the most vulnerable people, those least responsible for it, and those least able to adapt to its effects.\n\nAddressing global warming and tackling climate change require national and international action and policy changes. But individuals, households, and communities have a vital role to play too. Individuals in the major emitting nations can shift their day-to-day behavior and reduce their carbon footprint. Fishers, farmers, and other resource users in developing countries can also adopt climate-friendlier practices and reduce their impact on nature-based solutions to climate change,\n\nClimate change needs behavior change. And change is what Rare does best.\nIndividual behavior plays a significant role in reducing emissions, while paving the way toward large-scale climate action.\n\nMake It Personal meets people where they are to make climate-friendly behaviors easier to adopt.\nFish Forever inspires fishers to shift away from destructive practices that damage or destroy nature-based solutions to climate change like coral reefs and mangrove forests.\nLands for Life equips farmers with techniques to reduce their impact on the climate.\nCenter for Behavior & the Environment trains environmental practitioners in Behavior-Centered Design to maximize the impact of their work around the world.\nInvesting in people and nature as solutions to this threat builds social, ecological, and economic resilience to climate change.\n\nFish Forever works with communities to protect mangrove forests critical to carbon capture, as well as coral reefs that help reduce their vulnerability to climate change’s impacts.\nLands for Life empowers farmers and farming communities with the knowledge, tools, and awareness to protect one of the most important nature-based tools for capturing carbon – soil."

        "body": "Climate changes are occurring in every region and globally, according to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. As the world’s latest and most rigorous scientific assessment of the physical basis of climate change, the report defines changes that are unprecedented in thousands if not hundreds of thousands of years. It emphasizes that there is still time to act, but it must happen immediately. Limiting climate change demands strong and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from human activities such as burning fossil fuels.\nClimate action requires significant investment, but its value is immense: a livable climate. Countries around the world are showing how climate finance can improve people’s lives and prospects for the planet.\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, countries presented 110 new or updated climate action plans. But these make up only 58 per cent of the total, a shortfall that comes amid escalating impacts from the climate crisis."
